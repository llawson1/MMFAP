# Team Profile Feature Audit Report
*Date: June 24, 2025*

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Problem**: Team profile navigation from hero predictions is not working
**Status**: Critical - Core feature broken
**Impact**: Users cannot access detailed team analysis pages from homepage

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### 1. Routing Configuration Issues
- **Missing Route Registration**: TeamProfilePage component not properly registered in App.tsx routing
- **Import Statement Missing**: TeamProfilePage import not added to main App component
- **Path Mismatch**: Hero predictions may be generating incorrect team name formats for URL routing

### 2. Navigation Link Problems
- **Hero Predictions Component**: Links may not be properly encoded for team names with spaces/special characters
- **Click Handler Issues**: Potential event propagation or navigation state conflicts
- **URL Generation**: Team name encoding may not match route parameter expectations

### 3. Component Integration Gaps
- **Component Not Imported**: TeamProfilePage component exists but not integrated into routing system
- **Parameter Handling**: Route parameters may not be properly decoded in team profile component
- **State Management**: Navigation state not properly managed between components

## TECHNICAL AUDIT FINDINGS

## COMPREHENSIVE PLAYER DATABASE REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

Based on attached requirements, the current system needs major expansion:

### Current State vs Requirements Gap:

2. **Coaching Staff**: Full management teams, not just head coaches
3. **Statistical History**: Complete career statistics for all players
4. **Transfer History**: Comprehensive transfer records
5. **Injury Status**: Real-time injury tracking
6. **Market Values**: Current and historical valuations

### Data Source Integration Required:
1. **API-Football**: Comprehensive player/team data
2. **Sportmonks**: Detailed statistics and history
3. **Football-Data.org**: Official league data
4. **Transfermarkt**: Market values and transfer history
5. **Official League APIs**: Direct from Premier League, La Liga, etc.
