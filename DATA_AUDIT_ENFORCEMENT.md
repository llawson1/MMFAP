## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Data Validation Rules
```typescript
// ENFORCED: All data must pass authenticity verification
interface AuthenticDataSource {
  source: 'sportmonks' | 'matchday-finance' | 'sports-reference' | 'official-club' | 'verified-journalist';
  verificationUrl: string;
  lastVerified: Date;
  confidence: 100; // Only 100% verified data permitted
}
```

### Error Handling

- Never fall back to generated data
- Log missing data requests for API integration priority

## AUDIT COMPLIANCE
